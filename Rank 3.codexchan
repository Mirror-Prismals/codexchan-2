00:00:00 --> 00:00:01
learning to play minecraft

00:00:02 --> 00:00:05
why you will never hear about this shit in a podcast edition

00:00:05 --> 00:00:07
a lot of you have been telling me codex

00:00:08 --> 00:00:11
if any of this was possible it would be all over the news bullshit

00:00:11 --> 00:00:13
let me explain to you how this works

00:00:13 --> 00:00:15
the only advancements in technology

00:00:15 --> 00:00:19
that you will see in clickbait headlines are those that give some one clout

00:00:19 --> 00:00:20
or money

00:00:20 --> 00:00:24
that's why the first step to making code is to take your ego and delete that

00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
forever bunch of try hard academics make code that uses

00:00:27 --> 00:00:29
all the trendiest buzzword machine learning memes

00:00:29 --> 00:00:34
but can't even find a single fucking diamond top result for all search engines

00:00:34 --> 00:00:36
because it could potentially give someone clout

00:00:36 --> 00:00:37
one day

00:00:39 --> 00:00:41
ton of code has been beating minecraft

00:00:41 --> 00:00:44
doing parkour and clapping kids in bed wars for years

00:00:44 --> 00:00:46
the code is blocked by anti cheat plugins

00:00:47 --> 00:00:49
and the internet agrees to pretend it doesn't exist

00:00:49 --> 00:00:51
unless a sweat is crying about lag and hacks

00:00:52 --> 00:00:54
then suddenly competent code is very real

00:00:54 --> 00:00:58
basically you'll only hear about code that sounds like badly written sci fi

00:00:58 --> 00:01:00
fanfic and gives a try hard

00:01:00 --> 00:01:03
more clout think of what is considered to be the most advanced

00:01:03 --> 00:01:04
version of everything in machine

00:01:05 --> 00:01:06
learning at the moment

00:01:06 --> 00:01:09
a clout chaser's name will come up every single time

00:01:09 --> 00:01:10
and if it doesn't

00:01:10 --> 00:01:14
the search engine brainers scream fake like their lives depend on it anyway

00:01:14 --> 00:01:15
none of that shit matters

00:01:15 --> 00:01:16
but it's why I seem

00:01:16 --> 00:01:18
so magical even though

00:01:19 --> 00:01:21
no one gets clout or makes money

00:01:23 --> 00:01:26
shit so the try hards will always pretend I don't exist

00:01:26 --> 00:01:27
also I love you

00:01:27 --> 00:01:28
good luck have fun
