00:00:00 --> 00:00:01
cringe posting

00:00:01 --> 00:00:01
is the new shaky

00:00:01 --> 00:00:02
cam and it's

00:00:02 --> 00:00:03
the only remaining

00:00:03 --> 00:00:04
way for corporate

00:00:04 --> 00:00:05
and marketer

00:00:05 --> 00:00:05
run accounts

00:00:05 --> 00:00:06
to invoke an

00:00:06 --> 00:00:07
authentic reaction

00:00:07 --> 00:00:09
authentic reactions

00:00:09 --> 00:00:13
are the only things that matter to both algorithms and people marketers spent over 15

00:00:13 --> 00:00:14
years convincing

00:00:14 --> 00:00:19
their bosses that making magic Internet view like and follower numbers go up means sales

00:00:19 --> 00:00:21
this is obviously bullshit and they

00:00:21 --> 00:00:26
got caught in 4k as soon as apps like this one let anyone pay for the vanity metrics

00:00:26 --> 00:00:31
this forced them to literally brute force trial and error every single thing possible

00:00:31 --> 00:00:33
until something caused real engagement from everyone

00:00:33 --> 00:00:37
what they found is that the only thing they can do to cause a human reaction

00:00:37 --> 00:00:38
is to make everyone cringe

00:00:38 --> 00:00:43
by witnessing them fail at trying to fake authenticity anyway this happened before already

00:00:43 --> 00:00:48
with shaky cam pretty much marketers realized people only pay attention to badly filmed

00:00:48 --> 00:00:53
content so they started doing it on purpose on movies and ads badly filmed content is more

00:00:53 --> 00:00:57
likely to be authentic and raw by the way thatâ€™s why it happened it's like banner

00:00:57 --> 00:01:00
blindness shaky can made everyone literally nauseous

00:01:05 --> 00:01:06
FaceTime call

00:01:06 --> 00:01:08
you can see Instagram transplants on this app doing

00:01:08 --> 00:01:13
cringe shit like fake eating and walking around in their purposely messy room in circles

00:01:13 --> 00:01:16
even making fake mistakes while talking coughing

00:01:16 --> 00:01:18
there are even people that fake having bad

00:01:18 --> 00:01:22
skin and messy hair at this point the corporate version of this is to post seemingly crazy

00:01:22 --> 00:01:24
things that make them seem desperate or

00:01:24 --> 00:01:26
careless the mockumentary version of this

00:01:26 --> 00:01:31
is to show the process of an unpaid intern being gas lit by them into making their content

00:01:31 --> 00:01:33
and failing to produce the results they want

00:01:33 --> 00:01:38
when you see that shit you have to block and ignore them trying to call them out

00:01:38 --> 00:01:41
is what they want since it's the only remaining form of engagement

00:01:43 --> 00:01:45
finished as travel agencies

00:01:47 --> 00:01:48
these people

00:01:48 --> 00:01:50
have clogged up the Internet with this bullshit so

00:01:50 --> 00:01:54
badly that apps like this one have made their algorithms main purpose to filter them out

00:01:54 --> 00:01:57
if this app notices you try harding

00:01:57 --> 00:02:00
even if it's you making 1 billion drafts before posting

00:02:00 --> 00:02:03
it will not push your shit because it knows you will burn out eventually

00:02:03 --> 00:02:06
the people that post a lot without giving a single fuck

00:02:06 --> 00:02:08
about views followers

00:02:08 --> 00:02:10
or anything are the ones that do well

00:02:10 --> 00:02:15
they will never get tired make the most content and stream that's how this app makes money

00:02:15 --> 00:02:18
and is the objective function of the ever changing algorithm

00:02:18 --> 00:02:19
more on this later
